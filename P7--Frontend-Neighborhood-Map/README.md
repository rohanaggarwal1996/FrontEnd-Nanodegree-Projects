****************************
In This Project We have created Google Map with help of Google Console(https://console.developers.google.com/) in it a link to the Google API has been made and an API key has been added which is unique.
There is also Link to the Following References made in the project:
1. KnockoutJS
2. jQuery
3. FourSquare API
4. Google maps API
One should open the file index.html to load the google map. The Map Contains the information about various shopping malls in Ludhiana. Following is the description of it:
1. As you open the file with browser a map will load and would be pointing to 6 different locations with a marker placed on it.
2. On the right side of the window there would be the description of it and name of the places marked in the map is given.
3. The list given is in anchor tag as when one clicks on it would be redirected to the specific marker of that place pointing on it and displaying    the title of the place with particular attributions.
4. There is a search box in above list where one can the type the Malls name to refer to it.
5. There are two buttons below the list made named show listings and hide listings. The show listings will place the markers on the positions and hide listings will remove the markers from the page.
